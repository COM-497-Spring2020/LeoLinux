## Potential GUIs
The images in this folder were created through *Linux Mint* so that we could test different ideas on how we may want to structure the GUI of our *Leo Linux*.
None of these have been solidified as THE style of GUI that we intend to use, and we may decide to generate an entirely new layout all together.

| *Leo Linux* Version Number | GUI Notes |
| -------------------------- | --------- |
| 0.1 | First Possibilities Created. Files ``Config_1, Config_2, Config_3, and Config_4`` are all possibilities at this stage. |
| 1.0 | Discussions have narrowed down the possible choices to files ``1B or 2B``. The main difference between the two is the System Satus toolbar on the far right edge of the GUI. |
| 1.2 | General GUI Design has been finalized: See file ``2B`` for general design. Specifics to come as more programs, features, and tools are added. |

## *Leo Linux Logo*
A general design for the *Leo Linux* logo has been created; see file ``Leo Linux Logo v2.png`` for the icon-style logo. The files ``"Leo Linux Lovo v2.2 CF.png"`` and ``"Leo Linux Logo v2.3 CF.png"`` are variations of the original logo image on different sized solid-black backgrounds.
