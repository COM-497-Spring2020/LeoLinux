# ICON PACK
The current icon pack that we are considering using is an open-source pack called "Flat-Remix." This icon pack has four colors for users to choose from (Blue, Green, Red, and Yellow). This icon pack will ___not___ take the place of the custom icons we still have to create, but it will help with the generic ones that come pre-installed with the Xfce interface. The files for all four colors of the "Flat-Remix" icon pack can be found at the following GitHub repoistory: https://github.com/daniruiz/Flat-Remix
