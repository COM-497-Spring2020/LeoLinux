## *Leo Linux* Survey & Data

For this project we created a survey that was distributed to students all around Saint Leo University and a few other people outside Saint Leo to ensure breadth of response. This survey was created to provide feedback for a project planned for the Spring 2021 semester at Saint Leo University – the creation of a custom, student-oriented Linux distribution (*Leo Linux*). The survey asked participants about features – useful and unnecessary – as well as broaching the topic of beta testing and which survey participants would like to beta test when the time comes.

Contained in this directory is raw data collected from the survey itself, as well as a write-up done by Chase S. Franse on said data. This write-up also includes multiple figures to assist readers in understanding the results of the survey that was conducted.
