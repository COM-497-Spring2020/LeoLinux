# *Leo Linux*
The repository for COM 497 Group #2's project: *Leo Linux* (name pending).

Our vision for this project is a fully customized Linux operating system built for students and is efficient enough to rival Microsoftâ€™s *Windows*. This Linux distribution (distro) will be mainly geared towards college students majoring in Computer Science, Cybersecurity, or other related field, but will be diverse enough to provide an effective and enjoyable working environment for students of any major or specialization. We plan to get some assistance from looking at other successful Linux distros, as well as consulting the *Linux From Scratch*, and/or *Gentoo* documentation while creating a stable build that everyone can enjoy.

There are many different ways we could measure the success of our project. A few of the possibilities that are most important to us include: Is our distro a working, stable build? Do we have unique GUI options to set us apart from other projects? Is the distro practical for a working environment? Are the installation files light enough to allow for older hardware to run effectively? Our team will be answering all of these questions and more as we progress through our project, but the ultimate decision is left to Dr. Manh Van Nguyen of Saint Leo University.
